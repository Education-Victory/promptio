Question Description:
<br />
During a city-wide festival, a ride-sharing app like Uber needs to adapt fares dynamically based on demand. The company employs an algorithm that searches for pairs of fare adjustments from different zones that sum up to a target value. This ensures the fares are attractive to riders while providing fair compensation to drivers. The input consists of an array of integers, each representing a potential fare adjustment for a specific zone, and a target integer that represents the desired total fare adjustment. Importantly, the algorithm stipulates that each adjustment can only be used once, and there is only one valid pair of indices in the array that sums to the target, guaranteeing a unique solution for each scenario. The output is the indices of the two zones whose adjustments meet the target, enabling real-time pricing adjustments in response to fluctuating demand during the event. This setup highlights the critical role of efficient algorithms in implementing effective dynamic pricing strategies in response to market conditions.

### Response From AI Coach

<SimpleCodeDisplay type="response">
Based on the problem description you've provided, where the objective is to find two indices in an array whose values sum to a given target, let's identify the most suitable tags for solving this problem and compare them with the ones you've listed. I'll also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
<br />
Most Appropriate Tags:
- Two Pointers
- Hash Table
- Sorting

Comparison with Your Tags:
- Array: You mentioned ignoring this tag due to its ambiguity. While 'Array' is indeed a broad category, it is fundamentally relevant because the problem involves manipulating and searching within an array. However, it's true that more specific tags provide clearer guidance on the solution approach.
- Two Pointers: You included this, and it's indeed very relevant. It involves using two indices to scan the array, typically after sorting, to find two numbers that sum to the target.
- Sorting: You also included this tag, which is essential for the two-pointer approach as it relies on the array being sorted to function correctly.
- Segment Tree: This is less relevant for the problem as described. Segment trees are useful for range queries and updates, which are not required here.
- Hash Table: This was not included in your tags but is extremely relevant. It allows for efficient look-up and can solve the problem in linear time without needing to sort the array.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Tag:
<br />
Two Pointers
- Advantages: 1) Efficient for sorted arrays (O(n) time complexity after sorting).  2) Intuitive and easy to implement once the array is sorted.
- Disadvantages: 1) Requires the array to be sorted first, which incurs an O(n log n) time complexity. 2) Not suitable for unsorted arrays without prior sorting.

Hash Table
    - Advantages: 1) Very fast (O(n) time complexity), as it allows checking if the complement of the current element (target - current element) exists in the table.  2) Does not require sorting.
    - Disadvantages: 1) Uses extra space (O(n) space complexity). 2) Care must be taken to handle duplicates and ensure that the same element is not used twice unless explicitly allowed.

Sorting
   - Advantages: 1) Facilitates the use of the two-pointer technique. 2) Helps in other types of problems too, like binary search.
    - Disadvantages: 1) Time complexity of O(n log n) might not be optimal for all scenarios. 2) Only useful as a preliminary step for other techniques like two pointers or binary search.

Segment Tree
    - Advantages: Excellent for range queries and updates.
    - Disadvantages: 1) Overkill for problems simply requiring pair finding. 2) Complex to implement and understand compared to other methods.

In summary, while your tags mostly align with effective strategies for solving the problem, incorporating the Hash Table tag would offer a more direct and efficient approach, especially when sorting is not desirable or feasible. Each method has its own set of advantages and is best chosen based on specific problem constraints and requirements.

## 2. Ask for hint

Sometimes, knowing the category of the problem may not be enough to solve it. When this happens, you can let the AI Coach use Socratic questioning to help you solve this problem.

### Response from AI Coach

<SimpleCodeDisplay type="response">
Certainly! Let's use Socratic questioning to guide you towards solving the problem of finding two indices in an array whose values sum up to a given target. Here are three questions that can help you develop your understanding and approach:

- Can you think of a way to track which numbers you have already seen as you go through the array, and how might this help you determine if the complement of a current number (i.e., target - current number) has been seen before? (This question aims to lead you toward considering the use of a data structure that allows for fast access and lookup, such as a hash table.)
- If you were to sort the array first, how would you then use two pointers to find the two numbers that add up to the target? (This question encourages you to visualize the process and utility of sorting the array and then using two pointers to efficiently find the pair that meets the target sum.)
- Considering the need for an efficient solution, what are the trade-offs between using a sorting method followed by the two-pointer technique versus using a hash table in terms of time and space complexity? (Here, you're prompted to analyze and compare the efficiency of different approaches, helping you to choose the most suitable method based on the problem's constraints and requirements.)
    
These questions are designed to help you think through the problem and consider various methods and their implications, enabling you to develop a deeper understanding and select the best approach for solving the problem.

### Response From AI Coach

<SimpleCodeDisplay type="response">
Your solution using the Sorting and Two Pointers approach is well-structured and follows a logical sequence to solve the problem. However, I'll provide a detailed explanation of a potentially more efficient approach using a Hash Table and compare it with your solution.

Alternative Solution Using Hash Table:
- Tags: Hash Table
- Time Complexity: O(n), as each element is processed exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to storing elements and their indices in the hash table.
- Steps:
    1. Create an empty hash table to keep track of each number and its index as you iterate through the array.
    2. Iterate over the array. For each element, calculate the complement (i.e., target - current element).
    3. Check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, return the index of the current element and the index of the complement from the hash table as they sum up to the target.
    4. If the complement is not found, store the current element and its index in the hash table.
    5. Continue the process until a pair is found or the array is fully traversed.

Test Case Example:
- Input: array = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
- Expected Output: [0, 1] (since 2 + 7 = 9)

Using the Hash Table Approach:
1. Hash Table is \{\}.
2. Element 2, Complement 7. Hash Table becomes \{2: 0\}.
3. Element 7, Complement 2. Found 2 in Hash Table. Return \[0, 1\].

Comparison and Analysis, Your Solution (Sorting and Two Pointers):
- Steps Correctness: You've outlined the steps correctly for the sorting and two-pointer technique. This method works well and is efficient for sorted arrays.
- Efficiency: The time complexity of O(n log n) is primarily due to the sorting step. While efficient, it is not the fastest possible for this problem.
- Space Complexity: Correctly noted as O(1) assuming an in-place sort.

Potential Issues:
- Index Tracking: After sorting, the original indices of the elements are lost, which can be problematic if the original indices need to be returned. This requires additional steps to track indices, which were not mentioned in your steps.

Advantages of the Hash Table Method:
- Faster Time Complexity: Avoids the sorting step and operates in linear time, making it more efficient for large inputs.
- Simplicity and Direct Access: The hash table allows for immediate lookup of complement values, simplifying the logic and speeding up the solution process.
- Handling of Indices: Directly maintains and utilizes the original indices without additional complexity.

In summary, while your method is valid and well-structured, the hash table approach offers a faster and potentially more straightforward solution, especially when considering the need to maintain original indices. This makes it particularly suitable for scenarios where time efficiency is critical.
